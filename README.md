# TarZan - Free Roam RPG & Tower Defense üéÆ

> A dynamic RPG and Tower Defense game developed in **Unity** and **C#**. Dive into a procedurally generated world, tame wildlife, and defend your tower against waves of intelligent enemies. *(Created: September, 2023)*

## About The Project

**TarZan** combines the thrill of open-world exploration with the strategic challenge of tower defense. Players can freely roam a vast, procedurally generated world filled with unique biomes, interactive NPCs, and wildlife. The core of the game revolves around exploring the world to gather resources and companions, then defending a central tower against increasingly difficult waves of enemies.

## Core Mechanics

This game is built upon two powerful algorithms to create a unique and challenging experience every time you play.

-   **Procedural Terrain Generation**: The world is generated on the fly using the **Wave Function Collapse** algorithm. This ensures that every new game offers a fresh, unique, and unpredictable landscape to explore.
-   **A\* Pathfinding**: Enemies navigate the complex, procedurally generated terrain using the **A\* Pathfinding** algorithm. This allows them to intelligently find the most efficient route to their target, creating a dynamic and challenging gameplay experience, especially in the tower defense maze.
